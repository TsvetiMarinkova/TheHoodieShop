# The Hoodie Shop

## About the Project

**The Hoodie Shop** is a front-end web application that replicates the look and feel of an online shopping website for streetwear hoodies. The app is designed to showcase products, allow users to add items to their cart, choose shipping options, and register/login using a simple username system.

**Note:** This is not a functional shopping website—transactions are not processed. It is a portfolio project meant to demonstrate UI/UX design and front-end development skills.
